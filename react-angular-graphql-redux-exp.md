I really loved this course. It started with basic React, then moved into Redux. There was really good projects to get the feel of things. A Youtube Search app, A book selection app, and a Weather app that dispayed graphs.

* Basic React components vs containers
* Props vs State
* Ajax requests using Promise libraries
* Youtube Search App
  * Youtube API
  * Modeled state and passed props
* Redux
  * Actions, Reducers, Dispatch, Store
* Book Selection app
  * Used Redux to hold selected book
  * Redux connect for multiple component rendering
* React Router
  * route params
* Life cycle methods

This course was a nice Redux refresher and really helped me understand Redux. As good as Steven Griders course was, I did not get a proper feel for Redux. This course broke it down as a separate framework first.

* Plan JS Redux (no React)
* Middleware
  * Logger from scratch
  * Thunk Middleware from scratch
* Redux with React  
* Redux Dev Tools
* React Router
* Converting ES5 to ES6

* Primer on REST API
* Queries
  * bidirectional
  * nested
  * resolves
* GraphQLObjectType
* React and GraphQL
* Mutations
  * associating with components.
* auto data caching with Apollo
* Authentication with GraphQL and Apollo

This was a wonderful course on Angular 2. It showed just how simple Angular is compared to React. Tony really dug deep and showed an understanding of how it is actually working. It was not just a tutorial to make a project.


* Learn how AngularJS works:
 * directives
 * dependency injection
 * two way data binding
 * the digest loop
 * watchers
 * attributes
 * loosely typed arrays
 * the hash
 * the event loop.
* Code custom services.
* Design custom directives, understanding concepts like compile, link, and scope.
