This was the next level in connecting Javascript by understaing the most important aspect of it, the DOM.

* What is the DOM?
* Elements: selecting and isolating
* DOM nodes:
  * traversing
  * Appending
  * Cloning and removing
* HTML attributes
* Event listeners
* Bubbling

This course was really cool. We built fully functional, cross-platform libraries. It was a taste into libraries like Jquery and how they work. This may have been a bit over my head when I did it, but it was a great introduction. It wasn't until I took Tony Aliceas course that changed my whole outlook on JS.

* Targetting JS versions
* onLoad, onReady
* Namespacing
* cross-browser DOM manipulation

  * objects and object litterals
  * faking Namespacing
  * function statements and expressions
* This: finally understanding how this works

* Closures
* Function factories
* Call, apply and bind
* Classical vs Prototypal inheritance.
* Functions are objects
* Function constructors and prototype
* Typeof, instanceOf
* Examined jQuery framework
* Built a framework from scratch
* Touched on ES6
