I really loved this course. It started with basic React, then moved into Redux. There was really good projects to get the feel of things. A Youtube Search app, A book selection app, and a Weather app that dispayed graphs.

* Basic React components vs containers
* Props vs State
* Ajax requests using Promise libraries
* Youtube Search App
  * Youtube API
  * Modeled state and passed props
* Redux
  * Actions, Reducers, Dispatch, Store
* Book Selection app
  * Used Redux to hold selected book
  * Redux connect for multiple component rendering
* React Router
  * route params
* Life cycle methods

This course was a nice Redux refresher and really helped me understand Redux. As good as Steven Griders course was, I did not get a proper feel for Redux. This course broke it down as a separate framework first.

* Plan JS Redux (no React)
* Middleware
  * Logger from scratch
  * Thunk Middleware from scratch
* Redux with React  
* Redux Dev Tools
* React Router
* Converting ES5 to ES6

This course was mainly about GraphQL and it was a really good introduction. I can see how GraphQL will shape the future of some REST API's.

* Primer on REST API
* Queries
  * bidirectional
  * nested
  * resolves
* GraphQLObjectType
* React and GraphQL
* Mutations
  * associating with components.
* auto data caching with Apollo
* Authentication with GraphQL and Apollo
