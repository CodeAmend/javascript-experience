# Personal Projects




### [Lights Out React game]
(https://github.com/CodeAmend/Lights-Out-React-Redux)
> I built this to test my React ability. It is a game I grew up playing and I wanted to see if I could make it happen again.

* Hand sketched the ideas on graph paper
* Planed out the Actions and Components
* Manual HTML and CSS


### [CanVo] Canvas with Velocity
(https://github.com/CodeAmend/CanVo)
> **Michael Bruce Allen** [profile](https://www.michaelbruceallen.com) <br>

* Heavily inspired by JavaScript: The Weird Parts
* Similar to jQuery style framework
* Use of IIFE
* Having fun trying to learn physics with javaScript.



### [] Old Bull Tavern Website
[heroku version](https://obt-pro.herokuapp.com/)
(https://github.com/CodeAmend/old-bull-tools-flask)

> This project was inspired from not having proper documentation on wine we use at the Old Bull Tavern restaurant. I wanted a easy to use CMS where a manager can put in Food, Beer and Wine information in. This would populate the user website automatically.

> I started with wine because it seemed to be the biggest money maker at the restaurant. If we had a way to get quick knowledge / wine facts, we could sell a bottle much easier. This would increase profit at the restaurant and I could also make money selling this idea to the owner.

> I started this project first with PHP (because it was the only way I knew how to talk to a database) and eventually switched to Python and Flask. This was the flask version.

> I hand coded all of the HTML and CSS and learned some new skills to get this working. This was the first real project that I have ever tried to do. It was really difficult to figure out what order to do things in. So I hired a mentor.

> I hired a mentor and he helped skyrocket me into understanding.

* I learned to use Trello to organize user stories
* I learned Git version control with CLI
* I put on Heroku and made my first workin app.
* The register and login works (a bug with login/logout button)
* You can add users, wine and schedules
* all HTML and CSS was hand done without frameworks.
